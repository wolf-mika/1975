/**
 * threeCompat.js — single resolution point for the three.js dependency of the
 * mesh-processing pipeline modules (subdivision, regularize, displacement,
 * decimation, meshRepair, exportPipeline).
 *
 * Why this exists: those modules must run in THREE contexts —
 *   1. the page (resolves bare 'three' via the import map in index.html),
 *   2. Node test/bench scripts (resolves 'three' from node_modules),
 *   3. the export Web Worker (workers IGNORE the page's import map per the
 *      HTML spec, so a bare 'three' import throws there).
 * The try/catch below uses the bare specifier wherever it resolves (page,
 * Node — same module instance as the rest of the app, so instanceof checks
 * hold) and falls back to the CDN URL only inside workers.
 *
 * KEEP THE URL IN SYNC with the import map in index.html. The page will
 * usually have the file in HTTP cache already, so the worker fetch is cheap.
